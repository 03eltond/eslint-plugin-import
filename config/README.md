This package contains some pre-fabricated ESLint config files, intended for use
with [eslint-plugin-import](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import).

There are currently two configs provided:

- `import` (index): just the bare-bones rules that catch misspelled/missing names.
- `import/warnings`: the above, plus warnings for common mistakes.

Both configure the plugin for you.
